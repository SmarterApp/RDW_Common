/**
 * This class represents subject trait codes.
 * A trait code is used to identify additional scores for an exam.
 * The other trait attributes (purpose, category) are used for grouping score
 * values in reports. The other attribute values don't have to match the code
 * text but usually do.
 * 
 * For example, ELA has traits for five purposes, each with three categories.
 * SOCK_ARGU_ORG is the code that identifies the score for organization (ORG)
 * of the answer to the question with purpose argument (ARGU). Typically, a 
 * test result has one or more trait scores for a single purpose. In this 
 * example, a test result may have three ARGU scores, SOCK_ARGU_ORG, 
 * SOCK_ARGU_CON, SOCK_ARGU_EVI.
 * 
 * Note: this may be confusing because exam items are hardcoded to have three
 * trait scores. This is legacy behavior specific to SmarterBalanced subjects.
 * Although the traits logically refer to similar things, this Trait class 
 * deals with only the exam-level scores.
