This overall score falls into one of the four achievement levels shown here.

          <ClaimAchievementMessage><![CDATA[{0}''s results are also reported out into the four claims (i.e., areas) that together make up English language arts/literacy: Reading, Writing, Listening, and Research/Inquiry. These four claims are based on California''s academic standards, which describe the knowledge and skills students are expected to learn in grade eleven. If {0} received a score of "No Score Available" for any claim, this means he or she did not complete enough items to receive a score in that area.]]></ClaimAchievementMessage>
